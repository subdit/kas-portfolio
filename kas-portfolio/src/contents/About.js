                <p>
                I love sports and coding I like to create things by using code. I like the new technology as well because it's inspiring me. <br></br>
                I mostly focus on the Frontend because I love React.js, React Native, Node.js, and JavaScript(ES6) <br></br>
                Also, I hold a masterâ€™s degree in information technology from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where's all of the coding begin.
